    <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>A match made in heaven. Buffalo chicken with mac and cheese.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p><em>Original Recipe yields 8 servings.</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package elbow macaroni </li>
            <li>1 rotisserie-roasted chicken</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons butter </li>
            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground black pepper </li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup Frank's Redhot sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled gorgonzola cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
            <li>Cut wings and legs off rotisserie chicken. Skin and bone wings and legs; chop or shred dark meat into bite-size pieces.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Whisk in flour gradually until a thick paste forms. Cook until golden, about 1 minute. Pour in milk, whisking constantly, until thickened and bubbling, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook until sauce is smooth, about 1 minute more. Reduce heat and season sauce with black pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir Cheddar and Monterey Jack cheese into the sauce until melted and combined. Stir in hot sauce, adjusting to reach desired level of spiciness. Add blue cheese, chicken, and macaroni; mix well to combine.</li>
        </ol>
